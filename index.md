## Abstract

In today’s modern age, where science and technology have provided us with many facilities they
have also given birth to many social and moral evils. Internet is an example of a useful platform being
used for wrongful acts. Though we can acquire many benefits from it while simply sitting in our homes.

This is also true in case of Islam and the religious literature related to it. This is why many active
non-Muslims are spoiling the image of Islam through arguments for the sake of argument. They are also
using this unauthentic material for reference on international debate forums thus representing Islam in a
negative way. 

Our project Will eradicate evil caused by misinformation spread through internet. The absence of
any governing body over internet, having different rules and laws for internet in every country and its
being in the access of all types of people are the causes of the availability of fake and unauthentic materials
over internet very easily.

Some enemies of Islam intentionally add false materials on internet which is later used by other
anti-Islam forces as a proof. 

We are developing a project to rectify all these issues.

## Introduction

In today’s modern age, where science and technology have provided us with many facilities they have also given birth to many social and moral evils. 
The Internet is an example of a useful platform being used for wrongful acts. Though we can acquire many benefits from it while simply sitting in our homes. Our project Will also eradicate evil caused by misinformation spread through the internet. 

The absence of any governing body over the internet, having different rules and laws for internet in every country and its being in the access of all types of people are the causes of the availability of fake and unauthentic materials over the internet very easily. This is also true in the case of Islam and the religious literature related to it. This is why many active nonmuslims are spoiling the image of Islam through arguments for the sake of argument. They are also using this unauthentic material for reference on international debate forums thus representing Islam in a negative way. 

Under these circumstances, another threat is from Muslims with ignorant ideologies who are unaware of the basic knowledge and principles of Islam. These people share unauthentic information and knowledge on social media and other public speech forums as a reward worthy noble act. When a non-muslim sees the references of Quran and Hadith in it or translations of these sources he or she accepts it as true because a Muslim has shared it. Incidents like this damage the image of Islam badly. Because if this same non-muslim person searches this material on the internet for authenticity he either finds the same fake material which he or she has already read or he is unable to get access to the true sources of knowledge in the absence of the proper searchable forms. Thus this non-muslim person gets annoyed and stays away from Islam.

Some enemies of Islam intentionally add false materials on the internet which is later used by other anti-Islam forces as proof. 

We are developing a project to rectify all these issues. Which has this main quality among many others that it has intelligence like google. Which means that if someone searches in google with unclear and wrong spellings (like if someone tries to search water with its wrong spellings it senses itself what the client is trying to say)it brings relevant data by saying “did you mean this? “while no such search is available for Islamic literature which could only provide accurate and authentic information.

The intelligence based in this project will understand what the client is trying to ask. It will find the most relevant data from the Quran, Hadith, Islamic articles, and video and audio lectures about it. It also searches in already asked questions catalogs. This has never been done before. The details are explained later. Moreover, the API of this project will be prepared and made public. Through APIs anyone can access our features, services and databases. Any project (Web-based, Mobile-Based Desktop-Based) could use it free of cost. With the help of this, an authentic centralized database will be available for everyone. The key features of this project are as follows.

1. Intelligent search which contains in its database holy Quran, compilations of the Hadith, Islamic literature books, audio and video lectures and search in already asked questions catalogs will provide the most relevant information. If a person tries to search in the most insufficient words something he will find the appropriate answer. Some people try to misquote religion to defame it and provide information without proper references. For example, at one place Quran says don’t offer prayers so this search engine will open the other ayahs which help to understand the proper context in which these ayahs are in the Quran. This will clear all meanings. 

2. It will have the word by word meanings of the Quran. If one word is clicked then the Quranic origin, and multiple meanings of this will appear (many Quranic words have more than one meanings so it tells the meaning of that clicked word in its context). Along with these multi-language translations multiple Tafaseer will also be available. So that if anyone wants to look into the tafseer of another scholar he could benefit from it without any difficulty. 

3. There will be references, multi-language translation, and gradations of different levels in a Hadith. 

4. Articles of great scholars and their audio video lectures will be part of this database. Thus if someone asks a question against which there is a more relevant audio and video lecture of a scholar available that will show up in the search results too. 

5. And lastly, if a person is not satisfied with all the above options he or she could ask direct questions from scholars. Here he will also find a forum where all the previous questions will be listed so that the repetition of the same information could be avoided. By doing so we can also save the time of the user and as well as our respected scholars. This project is all done only to please Allah Subhanahu Watala so that the true and real representation of Islam could be made possible. 

Therefore, your cooperation and support of all sorts are very important for us. This cooperation could be in the form of data entry, web development, religious expertise, research work, and financial support.

Note: In case you are willing to be a part of our team a panel will interview you.


## Problem Statement

Among the many challenges concerning Islamic content in this modern age, one of the biggest is the lack of authenticity. The biggest hurdle in finding authenticity is the process of searching. There are many existing applications in place, prior to the start of our project, that are handling these issues. Although the importance and significance of authentic content cannot be denied the focus of these applications has mostly been on the initial part of the process which consists of collecting authentic content. 

Our project provides a very comprehensive solution to these basic issues and even goes a step ahead to provide an efficient search for authentic content. Because if we simply start accumulating authentic material we will be able to collect a huge amount of data through which one can easily find the desired content in little to no time. The other older projects used for this purpose contain an immense amount of deformities. 

The first biggest defect in the previous search systems is that they are word based searches and aren’t intelligence based, in which a word or a few words are compared with all the content that is in the data base. Through the search, the outcome would present all the times the word has been used. The first danger of this is that it provides an extensive amount of data all at once, and the second danger is that due to this one has to search through the content that is irrelevant and came in the search only due to word match. Furthermore, if the search is word specific and the search query is big it may be difficult to get the what one looks for because the search engine provides exact matched results. Thus, this may include the consequence of losing relevant data. 
The second big defect in the previous search systems is that if someone makes a spelling mistake, instead of asking like Google ‘Did you mean…?’ and giving suggestions of similar words, the other search engines don’t give any result at all because the exact word match is usually what they give as results.

Lastly, the third big problem in the other search systems is the prevalence of contextual search, through which our religion Islam is harmed sometimes. There are many Ayats and Hadiths that can be taken in different contexts and derived various meanings if the first or last few Ayats are not read as well.

Just as many non-believers quote the fifth Ayat of Surah Tobah saying that in the Qur’an it says to kill the non-believers and use this to justify calling all Muslims terrorists. In this case a Muslim with little knowledge will also be convinced of this and will be confused. There are many other instances where things can be considered left incomplete or completely wrong if the context is not taken into consideration. If we read the previous Ayaat of Surah Tobah we come to know that the Non-Believers and Muslims had a peace treaty. The Non-Believers broke this treaty and were still given four months to correct themselves, and a continuation under the terms of the treaty for those who hadn’t broken the treaty. The fifth Ayah comes after this which stated that they should be killed in war when the grace period of four months ends. In this context the current search system would be of no help. 

In today’s age most of the Islamic literature is stored in the form of audios or videos which is not covered by any Islamic web app or project. And if they do, they do not have the assistance of search. In this case there is a need for an Intelligence based search oriented platform which doesn’t only search through written material using intelligence and context, but also search through audio and video data. It would use these and provide the most relevant results whether they are in the form of videos, audios, or texts.

Very few websites offer users the option of asking questions directly on the Islamic forum. The users may not find the answers they are seeking in the data that is available on these websites or the data they are looking for may be available but due the faulty search function the users won’t be able to access the desired data.  

In conclusion, it is crucial to explain and understand that no website, web forum, or project provides a complete package that searches through the written, audio, and video data of Ahadees and the Qur’an to find the most relevant search to the questions people are seeking answers to. This program is a dire need for modern day.

## Proposed Solution

It is very important to correct those defects which have been mentioned in the previous section. Because the presence of these defects and the absence of the functionalities is causing many serious evils. In the given perspective our project will make up for these weaknesses. It will not only add these functionalities but will provide many more functionalities also.

In short our project has these qualities and functionalities: 

1. Authentic Data
2. Contextual Search
3. Intelligent Search
4. Question Answer Form
5. Written Articles Audio and Video Search
6. APIs 
7. Multi Lingual Translation
8. Dictionary 

- ### Authentic Data

All (Islamic Literature) Data will be collected under the supervision of experts and scholars. These scholars will belong to all sects and schools of thought so that harmony might be created and unity of Ummah is prevailed.

- ### Contextual Search

The answer to any search query will be given in proper context through this feature, for example if you have searched one such Ayah of Quran which has incomplete meaning without reference to previous Ayahs, or without the previous Ayahs meaning is completely changed which is shown in above example. It will give meaning of the Ayah within the whole context. In our project if a search query needs Quran, Hadith, Written Articles, Audios and Videos or the already asked questions in order to complete its meaning it will access them for help. And results will be shown from the most relevant to the less relevant gradually. The most relevant will have higher priority.

- ### Intelligent search

The search will be more relevant and accurate with the help of this feature. Therefore, if the spellings are wrong it will ask “did you mean this “like google and will provide the correct result freeing us from the word based search.

The major problem with word based search is that it is matched with the exact word and in case if the spellings are wrong no results are given.

The other main problem is that if the word arrangements are different from the titles of the audio video content and written data no data results will be shown despite the ample data present in base data.

- ### Question & Answer Form

In our project the facility to ask questions will also be at hand because most probably a user might not be satisfied with the result of his or her search query. This will be done with the help of learned scholars from all schools of thought and their selection will be done with extreme care so that the sectarian differences might be eliminated and the real attributes of Islam might be highlighted.

- ### Written Articles, Audio and Video Data

A lot of audio and video data and authentic written data will also be a part of our data base because a big portion of Islamic literature is in this form also.

- ### APIs

The use of APIs is one of the prominent features of this project. Therefore, our purpose is not only to provide authentic data of Islam to our users but also to grant access to other programmers and developers to this authentic data. These goals can only be achieved through APIs. Besides by using these APIs we want to end the monopoly y of those organizations who want to keep the authentic data only with themselves. Many sincere people who need to use this are truly aspiring to serve Islam.

- ### Multilingual translation

All data of our project will be available in the translation of different languages.

- ### Dictionary

The short description of all words of Quran and Hadith will be available. If a word has more than one meaning, then all other meanings will be presented there. Thus if a novice person has read these words with some other meanings elsewhere he might not consider this different meaning wrong.

## Future Work

1. Comparative studies
2. Science and Islam
3. Animation of Islamic worships
4. Child section 
5. Online tutor and classes 

- ### Comparative Studies

In the near future we also intend to add comparative religion functionality and initial work has also been started on this. With the help of this functionality a user from any other religion will be facilitated to have a better understanding through comparison of religions.

- ### Science and Islam

One of the major trials and tribulations is the inclination towards atheism or agnosticism which is affecting our youth rapidly. This young generation is not only very much impressed by science but is lacking in religious knowledge also. This behavior has resulted in the devastating situations where the answer to certain questions is not in science, people still reach out to science for these religious questions. We want to provide our youth (with) answers of these questions which religion has given long ago. Without access to this religious literature the youth is getting erroneous views about religion.

- ### Animation of Islamic worship

Reverted Muslims or such Muslims who were Muslims in their past but were away from Islamic teachings and now desire to learn how to perform Salat or ablution and other pillars of Islam will be conveniently taught these with the help of animation.

- ### Child section

One of major trials of this age is to provide such entertainment to our children which is not against Islamic teachings. We are planning to work on this aspect also.

- ### Online tutors and classes

The facility of Learning the Holy Quran and its Tajweed will also be provided. Moreover, such online classes will be initiated in which a large number of people could enroll and get Islamic education.
